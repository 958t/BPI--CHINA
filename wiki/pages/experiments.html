    <h3>3 Transformation of the plasmid into BL21(DE3) E. coli</h3>
    <p> The procedure is based on the Trans5a conversion manual, with minor modifications, and is as follows.</p>
    <p>1 10 μL of ligation product was added to 50 μL of just melted competent cells, mixed gently, and left on ice for 30min.</p>
    <p>2. Heat shock at 42° C for 45 s, quickly transfer to an ice bath and place for 2min. Please do not shake the centrifuge tube during this process.</p>
    <p>3. Add 500μL LB liquid medium（Kan+）, 37℃, 200 rpm, and incubate for 1h to revive the bacteria.</p>
    <p>4, Centrifuge the bacteria at 5000 rpm for 2 minutes. Collect the bacteria and discard a portion of the supernatant. Resuspend the remaining bacteria and inoculate them onto an LB liquid medium（Kan+） Incubate the culture overnight (12-14h) in an inverted incubator at a constant temperature of 37℃.</p>

    <h3>4 inoculate single colonies</h3>
    <p>The methodology follows Han (2016) with slight modifications as follows:</p>
    <p>The recombinant plasmid pET-Cas12a was transferred into the expression strain BL21 sensory state and, after the correct identification of colonies, prokaryotic expression was carried out.</p>
    <p>1. BL21 colonies containing the correctly identified recombinant plasmid pET-Cas12a were inoculated into 5 mL LB liquid medium（Kan+）at 37 ℃, 200 rpm, for shock culture for 12-16 h.</p>
    <p>2. Absorb 2 mL of the bacterial solution cultured overnight into 200 mL of LB liquid medium（Kan+）, and culture with shaking at 37 ℃, 200 rpm, until the bacterial solution is about OD600 to 0.5, about 2-3 h.</p>
    <p>3. 1.5 mL bacterial solution was aspirated as a whole cell control before IPTG induction and stored at -20 ° C</p>
    <p>4. Add IPTG until the final concentration is 0.5mmol /L, 1mmol /L, and 1.5mmol /L, respectively, at 37 ℃ and 150 rpm, and oscillate for 3-6 h.</p>
    <p>5. 1.5 mL of bacterial solution was aspirated as a whole cell control after IPTG induction and stored at -20 ° C.</p>
    <p>6, The rest of the bacteria were centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 4 ° C for 5 min, and the bacteria were collected. After the supernatant was discarded, the bacteria were repeatedly frozen and thawed 3 to 4 times with liquid nitrogen (if liquid nitrogen was not available, the bacteria were washed twice with PBS, resuspended with 1ml lysate, and added with a final concentration of 1mmol/L PMSF solution. Crushed on ice with an ultrasonic crusher).</p>
    <p>7. The bacteria were resuspended in 20 mL of ice-cold PBS for precipitation, and then crushed by an ultrasonic crusher on ice until the bacterial solution was translucent to avoid bubbles, and ultrasonic crushing was carried out on ice.</p>
    <p>8. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 ℃ for 10 min, the supernatant and precipitate were aspirated and subjected to SDS-PAGE to observe the expression and dissolution of GST fusion protein. If the expression of the pET-Cas12a fusion protein is high and in the supernatant, proceed to the next purification test. If the expression of the pET-Cas12a fusion protein is low or in precipitation, IPTG concentration and incubation temperature should be optimized.</p>

          <p>Principle:</p>
          <p>The lateral chromatographic test strip used in this method has two strips, the lower quality control line and the upper detection line. The quality control line was coated with avidin (SA), the detection line was coated with sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody, and the colloidal gold was labeled with anti-FAM /FITC monoclonal antibody. The complete reporter molecule (Biotin and FAM/FITC labeled at both ends) could capture all the colloidal gold at the quality control line. When a reporter molecule was cut off by Cas enzyme, the colloidal gold bound to the cut fragment could not be captured by the quality control line, forming a detection line. Activation of the Cas enzyme was determined by the presence or absence of the detection line.
