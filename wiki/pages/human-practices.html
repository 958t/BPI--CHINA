          <p>As one of the world's most familiar chatting apps, WeChat now has 1.3 billion users, ranking third in the world.With the rapid development of WeChat, the influence of WeChat public number is also very significant, WeChat public number is a kind of information dissemination with both media attributes and social attributes, we chose to use this as one of the ways to output ideas, our team created WeChat public number "BPI iGEM".
            By default, we send surveys and a short description of the program to some new followers.Through these articles we tell the world about our team and our program, synthetic biology and our actions during the competition, our aim is to let the world know more about synthetic biology and more about our program so that the world can give us more and better feedback and then we can better improve our program and serve the world.

          <p>In order to give the public a better understanding of the impact of synthetic biology on the world, we decided to organize lectures related to synthetic biology, but due to various reasons we were unable to invite people from different regions to attend, so we decided to hold offline lectures at our school, inviting members of the public from around the area as well as our tutors to attend. We also held a Tencent online meetup for the lecture.
            During the free discussion session, students discussed intensely and showed their wild imagination. We think the lecture was very successful and made the public have more understanding and interest in synthetic biology. Then in the future we hope more students will study synthetic biology and participate in iGEM competition.
            The online conference held turned out surprisingly well, something we didn't expect at the beginning, with everyone from elementary school students who didn't know anything about biology to college students interested in biology, as well as people from other industries participating. During the presentation, we used a lot of pictures and videos to attract their attention, they kept asking questions and expressing their opinions online, they were curious about the iGEM competition that we were participating in, they were curious about how we could detect myocardial infarction using synthetic biology, and our team members answered their confusion in detail, and at the same time, they also brought up a lot of things that we hadn't thought about At the same time, they also raised a lot of things that we hadn't considered, for example, about biosecurity. For this reason, we decided to collect everyone's questions first and hold another lecture later to answer them better. Overall, the talk succeeded in stimulating people's interest in synthetic biology.

          <p>After a lecture on synthetic biology, there is a lot of controversy among many people about the biosafety issues and biosecurity of synthetic biology.Since its birth, synthetic biology has been developing at a very fast speed. Like many high technologies, synthetic biology brings benefits but also inevitably brings some problems such as safety and ethical issues. One student said that synthetic biology is like a sword, it can help human beings to get what they want and at the same time, it can also harm the world and bring troubles to human beings because of various improper behaviors.On top of this sword are we human beings, how to make use of this "sword" is how we make rules, so that there is a certain degree of standardization.</p>

          <p>In an effort to achieve a two-way dialogue between us and the world, to understand the public's understanding of myocardial infarction and the importance of preventing myocardial infarction, and to understand the real needs of the public so that we can better improve, refine, and implement our programs, we decided to go into the community and interview some of the residents.During the interviews, we heard different voices. Among the very few people who knew something about heart attacks, they shared their worries about suffering from them as well as they gave some tips on how to prevent them in their daily lives.
            In the course of the interview, Mr. Li told us, like people suffering from heart attacks should be accompanied by medication, heart attacks are not like other diseases it's very high suddenness, in daily life, your mood is best to calm some, in eating to be lighter, to go to exercise more sports, if you suffer from a heart attack bed rest is the most basic, and then to be to take medication, and if the seriousness of the you have to do the operation, which not only on their own body, psychological damage, if the long-term treatment down to the family also add a lot of economic pressure.
            During this community visit, we found that the public's awareness of heart attack prevention was not very high, and we are planning to hold a promotional activity on "Heart Attack Prevention" to enhance the public's awareness of heart attack prevention around us.

We set up a booth and in order to let people know more about our program and the importance of heart attack prevention, we placed some easy-openings in front of the booth, and we also prepared some pamphlets about our team to give to the public, and we also prepared some general knowledge about heart attack. We also prepared some general knowledge about heart attack for the public who were willing to take the challenge.Many members of the public stopped by our booth to look at our easy-to-use billboards, and many came to challenge our heart attack knowledge. The event came to a successful conclusion and our goal of preventing heart attacks was achieved.</p>
